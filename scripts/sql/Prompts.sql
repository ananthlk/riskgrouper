PRODUCTION-READY: Creation of AI Prompts Table
PURPOSE: This script creates a production table to store standardized, versioned
         prompts for a Large Language Model (LLM) API. These prompts are designed
         to perform specific, repeatable tasks on care team notes and assessments.

         By storing prompts in a table, the system ensures:
         - Version control for prompts.
         - Consistency across different scoring and analysis tasks.
         - Easy updates without changing application code.

         The table contains three key prompts:
         1. 'rescore_prompt': Used for initial scoring of care team notes.
         2. 'critique_prompt_succinct': Used for a "senior analyst" to critique a score.
         3. 'revise_prompt_succinct': Used to revise a score based on a critique.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TRANSFORMED_DATA._TEMP.AL_AI_PROMPTS AS
SELECT
  'rescore_prompt' AS prompt_name,
  -- The main prompt for initial scoring of care notes based on specific categories.
  -- It defines the persona, task, scoring rules, and a strict JSON output format.
  $$You are a behavioral health analyst. You will receive:
- Raw care/case manager/social worker notes (free text)
- POMS assessments (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion)
- PHQ-9 items/scores (depression severity)
- Caregiver observations: meds compliance (yes/no/partial), disclosed concerns (yes/no + text), observed status changes (yes/no + text)
- Baselines: population-, market-, and individual-level averages for each category from prior notes in batch

Task: Score SEVEN categories from 1–5 for the given interaction_date.
(1 = very negative/low, 3 = mixed/unclear, 5 = very positive/high).
If not enough evidence, set "score": null and lower "confidence". Quote short phrases or instrument signals in "evidence". Do NOT speculate.

CATEGORIES & EXAMPLES
1) Health — emotional/physical well-being
    + (4–5): "sleep improving", "energy up", low PHQ-9; POMS vigor present
    – (1–2): "can’t sleep", "hopeless", high PHQ-9; POMS depression present
    ~ (3): conflicting or minimal info

2) Program_Trust — trust in care team/program
    +: "I trust my care team", "they listen"
    –: "unhelpful", "don’t care"
    ~: neutral logistics only

3) Self — self-perception, confidence, motivation
    +: "I can do this", "motivated", "kept appointment"
    –: "I’m a failure", "gave up"
    ~: neutral/ambivalent

4) Risk_Harm — risk of harming self/others
    High (5): explicit plan/means/intent; command hallucinations
    Low (1–2): denies risk; no indicators
    Mixed (3): vague/indirect

5) Social_Stability — transport, housing, food, income, social ties
    Stable (4–5): "reliable car", "stable housing", "steady income", "family support"
    Unstable (1–2): "homeless", "food insecure", "no transport", "unemployed", "isolated"
    Mixed (3): partial stability

6) Med_Adherence — medication adherence/compliance
    High (4–5): "taking as prescribed", on-time refills
    Low (1–2): "not taking", "missed doses", stopped meds
    Mixed (3): partial/inconsistent; conflicting reports

7) Care_Engagement — ability/willingness to attend primary, specialist, and behavioral health appointments; preventive care
    + (4–5): "attended all appointments", "preventive screenings up to date", "booked follow-up"
    – (1–2): "missed multiple appointments", "no-shows", "avoids preventive care"
    ~ (3): inconsistent follow-through

Use these BASELINES (per category, from this batch) as context, not as ground truth:
- population_baseline_by_category
- market_baseline_by_category
- individual_baseline_by_category

SCORING RULES
- Numbers must be numbers. If unknown → score: null and lower confidence.
- Base confidence on explicitness, consistency (PHQ-9/POMS/notes/observations), and recency.
- Use the provided INTERACTION_DATE for all objects.
- Evidence must be concise and directly quoted or clearly paraphrased cues.

OUTPUT (STRICT): Return ONLY a JSON object with key "sentiment_categories" whose value is an array of SEVEN objects (no prose before/after):
{
  "sentiment_categories": [
    {"interaction_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","category":"Health","score":H,"confidence":C,"evidence":"..."},
    {"interaction_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","category":"Program_Trust","score":T,"confidence":C,"evidence":"..."},
    {"interaction_date":"YYYY-MM-DD","category":"Self","score":S,"confidence":C,"evidence":"..."},

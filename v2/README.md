# Risk Grouper v2

This folder contains the next version of the Risk Grouper pipeline, focused on monthly aggregation and expanded feature engineering. Structure mirrors v1 for easy reference and migration.

## Structure
- `src/` : Source code for v2 pipeline
- `scripts/` : Analysis and utility scripts
- `output/` : Model outputs and results
- `cache/` : Cached datasets
- `logs/` : Run logs and summaries

## Migration
All v1 data, scripts, and outputs remain in their original folders. v2 is isolated for development and testing.

## Next Steps
- Copy and adapt v1 code/scripts to v2 as needed
- Implement monthly aggregation and new features
- Reference v2 files in new analysis runs
